# Speedy Antlr Project

This is a template project from
[`speedy-antlr-tool`](https://github.com/amykyta3/speedy-antlr-tool)
to build an extension that makes Antlr for Python super fast!

This implements an automatically-generated package called `{{grammar_name|lower}}`. For a detailed
walk-through of how everything works, see the
[Speedy Antlr Tutorial](https://speedy-antlr-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html).
